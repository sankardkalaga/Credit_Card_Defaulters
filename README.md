# Credit_Card_Defaulters
The objective of the project is to identify the defualters of a credit card company based on the key features such as age, education, pay amount, bill amount etc. The dataset consists of 30000 customers with the 24 features, the last feature "default.payment.next.month" is set to 1 for defualter and 0 for non-defaulter. Out of all Untuned models SVC performed better on all 3 train test splits (85%, 80%, 70%, and 60%) with train and test F1 scores of 0.47 and 0.43. After hyperparameter optimization SVC accuracy of 80%. The optimized support vector classifier (SVC) has TRUE POSITIVES of 320 and TRUE NEGATIVES of 4500. SVC model IDENTIFIED 320 as customers who are willing to default next month bill who are actually willing to default. SVC correctly identified 4500 customers as GENUINE who are actually genuine. The optimized SVC has FALSE NEGATIVES of 160 and FLASE POSITIVES of 1000. SVC model wrongly predicted that 160 who are willing to default the next month payment as genuine and wont default next month. SVC model wrongly predicted 1000 genuine customers as potential next month defaulters. From the data analysis, we see that customers with the features such as Gender: Female, Education: higher education Status: single Age: Between 30-40 are more likely to pay the credit card bills on time.
